           <p>Hello, I am Wilkie Overton III. Born and raised in Austin Texas. I spent most of my life in Texas. I am probably one of the last born Austin-nite, that still in the area. I am one of four children with two brothers, one older and one younger, and sharing the middle with my older sister.</p>
           <p>In 1997, I left Austin to attend Angelo State University.While in college I began working with persons with disabilities. I started working directly with them training and teaching them how to do daily activities (cleaning, shopping, cooking). I enjoyed just helping them do things that we normally take for granted. I have been working with my current company for the last eight years. Here I use the skill that I have learned over my past employment with the state to provide clients with therapies and services they need. I also provide tech support to my office and other offices around the state.</p>
           <p>My fascination with computers started when I was a kid with the discovery of video games. Most of my childhood was spent gaming. I took my first coding class in ninth grade. It was mostly working with Pascal language. While in college I took a computer science class for an elective, but it was just a history course. So now I am jumping back in to something that I always wanted to do and so far, it is great. Welcome to my page.
